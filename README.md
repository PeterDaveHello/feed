feed v0.2
====

Just a RSS Feed Reader

Right now it will display my favorite website Techcrunch's rss feed by default. And you can add some feed by click on "Add Feed" on the left side to enter "Title" and "URL"(ex: "Techcrunch" on the Title field and "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/" on the URL field). Press Enter then there you go! You will see it add to the list above "Add Feed" and show the content on the right side.

### Caution

For now the data you enter will save in Local Storage. That means it only save on your browser. If you change to another one the data will not be there.

Feel free to leave comment on issues, email me to send push request to improve this. Many thanks!
